# CryptoClustering
Module 19 - Unsupervised Machine Learning

####In this assignment I utilize crypto market data, and create K-means algorithm for clustering the crypto currencies into distinct clusters, where the optimal number of clusters is found using the elbow curve method. For further analysis of the clustering, the data is processed through a PCA model, and the K-means model is repeated again to see if any visible distinctions were made.
